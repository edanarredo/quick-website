      <h1 class="light-text">Values and Interests</h1>
      <p class="light-text">I love my family - my mom and two sisters. I value taking care of myself by working out,
        eating healthy, getting stuff done when I need to, and giving myself time off. On my time off I like cleaning
        and planning things like recipes to try out, road trips, room ideas, or new hobbies. Things I enjoy doing
        include meditation, prayer, playing video games (Zelda, FFXIV, and Nier) and watching anime.</p>

      <hr class="light-text">

      <h1 class="light-text">Aspirations</h1>
      <p class="light-text">I want to finish and obtain my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and continue working in
        the tech industry for a bit. I'm considering focusing on IT/Cloud Engineering for now. Then figure out a way to
        make some decent side-income (through a self-managed product, app or service), and eventually closing out my
        career by teaching high-school level courses on anything that interests me.</p>

      <p class="light-text">It is in my nature to try out a ton of things, so I'd like to continue doing that by
        learning new things (such as singing, dancing, drawing) and also improve what I currently know because I enjoy
        doing that.</p>
